# 1.7. Anotations (Level 1 - Exercise 1)

## Project Description üìÑ

This Java program solves the following exercise:

"Create an object hierarchy with three classes: Worker, OnlineWorker, and OnsiteWorker.

The Worker class has the attributes name, surname, hourly rate, and the method calculateSalary(), which receives the number of hours worked as a parameter and multiplies it by the hourly rate. The child classes must override this method using the @Override annotation.

From the main() method in the Main class, make the necessary calls to demonstrate the functionality of the @Override annotation.

For OnsiteWorkers, the salary calculation method will receive the number of hours worked per month as a parameter. The salary will be calculated by multiplying the number of hours worked by the hourly rate, plus the value of a static attribute called fuel, which will be added to this class.

For OnlineWorkers, the salary calculation method will receive the number of hours worked per month as a parameter. The salary will be calculated by multiplying the number of hours worked by the hourly rate and adding the flat-rate Internet fee, which will be a constant in the OnlineWorker class."

This program demonstrates **object-oriented programming (OOP)** concepts, including **inheritance**, **method overriding**, and **static attributes**. The program defines a **hierarchy of worker classes** with different salary calculation methods.

Its goal is to understand and implement **inheritance** in Java, learn how to **override** methods using `@Override` and use **static attributes** and **constants** for specific class-based logic.
